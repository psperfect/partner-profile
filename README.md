🌟 Partner Profile Management System – Laravel Project
Welcome to the Partner Profile Management System, a robust and feature-rich Laravel-based web application designed to streamline the onboarding and service listing processes for a diverse range of business partners. Whether you're building a B2B marketplace, an appointment-based service platform, or a collaborative service directory, this project provides a solid foundation to manage partners, their services, and availability with ease and scalability.

🚀 Key Features
🔹 Multi-Type Partner Registration
Partners from various industries and business domains can register themselves through a smooth, intuitive interface. The system supports different types of partners—retailers, service providers, consultants, and more—tailored to your application's needs.

🔹 Admin Verification Workflow
Once a partner registers, an admin-verification flow ensures quality and authenticity. Only verified partners gain access to the platform's full capabilities, safeguarding the platform's integrity.

🔹 Dynamic Service and Product Listings
After verification, partners can list their services and products in detail. The listing process is fully dynamic, allowing partners to include pricing, categories, descriptions, images, and more.

🔹 Custom Time Slot Management
Partners can define their availability through a flexible time-slot management system. Whether they offer services by the hour, day, or custom time frames, the interface adapts to their preferences.

🔹 Business Profile and Information Management
Each partner has access to a comprehensive profile page where they can manage their business information including contact details, location, branding assets, and business hours.
